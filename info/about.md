This is a community maintained site to complement + support [mns.school.nz](https://mns.school.nz).

When my daughter started at MNS I found the array of ways to school communicates a bit overwhelming. Pretty soon my daughter was singing beautiful songs ... and I couldn't sing along because I didn't know the words.

How hard could it be to improve this? Seems doable!

Better yet, what if this wasn't some project that cost our busy school extra work... what if we practiced supporting our [tamariki](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=tamariki) by practicing noticing and gifting?

I want other families to be able to support their . Long term I want to see a thriving community deeply engaged in learning.

Spotted something that would enhance this site? hit me up
<a href="mailto:mix@protozoa.nz" >`mix <mix@protozoa.nz>`</a>. My plan is for this to be held by families, so if you'd like to become an author/ maintainer, I'd love to onboard you.

## What's with the name?

The domain name `mns.sch00l.nz` is tweak on `mns.school.nz`, which is a nod to the amazing civic project [g0v](https://g0v.tw/intl/en/) ("gov zero"):

> g0v is a grassroots social movement community dedicated to deepening the civic engagements and connections between the social arena and citizens. You can find like-minded partners in the g0v community, achieve your ideas in a grassroots manner, and then release the results under an open-source license, letting people stand on your shoulders.
> 
> g0v replaces "o" in gov with "0", which reimagines the role of government from scratch zero and reflects the vision from 0 to 1 of the digital natives.
