# Matariki !

Matariki is the Māori new year. It's a [public holiday](https://www.govt.nz/browse/work/public-holidays-and-work/public-holidays-and-anniversary-dates/) and in 2025 lands on **Friday June 20th**.

Most years MNS celebrate Matariki with a hāngī. Sarah Macintosh has been the
champion of this, but it's a huge community effort. It's a beautiful way to
learn more about Te Ao Māori, and to connect with other families from our
school.

## Roles

There are lots of ways people can contribute, such as:
- working with sponsors
- picking up supplies
- peeling some vege
- preparing the food trays
- tending the hāngī fire
- distributing hāngī orders


## How to join

Stay tuned for how you can help this year!
