# Edible Garden

This is a project being led by Mrs Kesrey + Debs. They're building a garden
which the students can contribute to, learn from, and be proud of.


## Roles

> _We are looking for a handful of volunteers (parents or grandparents etc),
> who have the time to go on a rosta to do some weeding in the edible garden or
> you could just wander up to the garden once in a while and see if anything
> needs doing.  We are trying to keep on top of the weeding and other jobs._

To be determined. Could be things like:
- weeding
- watering
- sourcing mulch
- maybe helping set up a roster
