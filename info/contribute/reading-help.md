# Reading Help

Literacy is a core skill for everyone in society. Some kids need a little more practice, so the school pairs them up with a volunteer.


## Role

Reading helpers chip in 30mins a week, typically in the afternoon right before
pickup (2.15 - 2.45pm). You'll work one-on-one with a kid reading a book -
basically they read, and cheer them on, or help them with any words they get
stuck with.

This is a role grandparents are welcome to help out with too!


## How to join

  The school with organise getting a police check. There's a simple form giving consent for them to check you're good to work in schools. It costs nothing, but does take 2-6 weeks to process.
