# Purea Nei

```
Purea nei e te hau 
Horoia e te ua
Whitiwhitia e te rā
Māhea ake ngā poraruraru
Makere ana ngā here

E rere wairua, e rere
Ki ngā ao o te rangi 
Whitiwhitia e te rā 
Māhea ake ngā poraruraru 
Makere ana ngā here,
Makere ana ngā here.
```

## English translation

```
Swept by the wind
Cleansed by the rain
Illuminated by the sun
Disappear all the troubles, troubles
Broken are the chains

Fly, spirit, fly
To the realms of the sky
Illuminated by the sun
Disappear all the troubles
Broken are the chains,
Broken are the chains.
```
