# Tōku reo

Tōku reo toku ohoho māpihi maurea whakakaimarihi

Nei ra te kaupapa

Nei rā te kaupapa ko te reo Māori e
He taonga tuku iho nō ngā tipuna
He parekawakawa, he mea hirahira e
Tōku reo toku ohoho māpihi maurea whakakaimarihi

Kōrerotia te reo i ngā wa katoa
Kia kore e rite ki te Moa
Mana tangata, mana mōtuhake
Tōku reo toku ohoho māpihi maurea whakakaimarihi

Tōku reo toku ohoho māpihi maurea whakakaimarihi

My language, my precious adornment, enhancing prestige

This is the theme

The theme today is the Māori language
It is a treasured legacy from our ancestors
A sacred and esteemed possession
My language, my precious adornment, enhancing prestige

Speak the language at all times
So it does not become like the Moa
A source of pride, a unique identity
My language, my precious adornment, enhancing prestige

My language, my precious adornment, enhancing prestige
