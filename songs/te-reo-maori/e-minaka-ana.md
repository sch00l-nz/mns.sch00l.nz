# E minaka ana


```
Kia kaha tātou
Ki te (HI!) kōrero Māori!

E minaka ana taku waha
Ki te kai a te rangatira,
Taku reo rangatira
Taku kuru pounamu tuku iho.

Mīharo kē ana
Ki tōna pakari kia ora
Tē memeha, te wairua
ki te kōrero Māori

Kia kaha tātou
Ki te (HI!) kōrero Māori!
```

## English Translation

```
Let us be strong
To speak Māori!

My mouth is eager
For the food of chiefs,
My noble language
My precious greenstone handed down.

Amazing it is
To its strength for life
The inspiration, the spirit
To speak Māori

Let us be strong
To speak Māori!
